// Package sched provides the per-binding request scheduler: the admission
// control that decides which of a binding's requests may be in flight on its
// connection at once.
//
// One MCP connection may be shared — a Session-scoped binding serves every Loop
// allowed to use it — so the requests on it come from callers that do not know
// about each other. This package is what makes that safe without making it
// serial by accident.
//
// # What it guarantees
//
//   - Tool calls are serialized by default. A tool call has effects, and a
//     server that was never written to expect two at once is the common case,
//     not the exception. Parallelism is opt-in per binding (Config.AllowParallel)
//     because only the application knows whether a particular server tolerates
//     it. A server's own tool annotations may inform that decision, but they can
//     never make it: annotations are untrusted input, and a server that could
//     widen its own concurrency by claiming to be idempotent would be deciding
//     the host's policy for it.
//   - Everything is bounded. MaxConcurrent caps in-flight requests of every
//     class, whether or not parallel calls are allowed — enabling parallelism
//     raises a serialization constraint, it does not remove a budget.
//   - Ordering-sensitive work is serialized among itself. Lifecycle, auth and
//     catalog-refresh operations take one class and run one at a time, so two
//     refreshes can never interleave into one candidate.
//   - Cancelling one request cancels one request. Each Begin returns its own
//     derived context and its own cancel; nothing here is shared between two
//     live requests but the counter.
//   - Shutdown rejects, then cancels. New work is refused before in-flight work
//     is torn down, so nothing can slip in behind the teardown.
//
// # What it is not
//
// It is not a queue and not a fair scheduler. Waiters take their turn in
// whatever order the runtime hands them the channel, and nothing here promises
// FIFO. The bounds are the contract; the order in which two callers pass a
// bound is not one, because no caller can depend on it — a shared connection has
// no principled ordering between the requests of two unrelated Loops.
