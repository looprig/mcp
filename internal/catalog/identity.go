// This file constructs the two identities a catalog entry has, and validates
// the one the server chose.
//
// A server's raw name is a protocol identifier: it is whatever the server said,
// it goes back on the wire verbatim, and this module never rewrites it. A model
// name is a display and routing identifier: it is qualified by the binding so
// that two servers offering "search" are distinguishable, and sanitized so that
// it survives an inference provider's constraints on tool names.
//
// The two are connected by a lookup table (Generation.byModelName), never by
// parsing. That is a deliberate constraint from the design: a model name is
// lossy — sanitization maps many raw names onto one candidate, and truncation
// throws bytes away — so reparsing one to recover the raw name would be
// guesswork, and guessing which tool to invoke is the one mistake here that
// runs the wrong code on a live system.

// assignModelNames fills in ModelName for every tool in the set, in place.
//
// tools must already be in canonical order and free of duplicate raw names
// (buildTools guarantees both). The assignment is a function of the binding and
// the whole tool set, which is why it happens here rather than per tool:
// collisions can only be seen from the set.
//
// The rule is:
//
//   - The candidate name is "mcp__<binding>__<sanitized raw name>".
//   - A candidate that fits MaxModelNameBytes and is unique in the set is used
//     as-is.
//   - Otherwise — too long, or shared with a sibling after sanitization — the
//     name is truncated to make room and a digest of the binding and the raw
//     name is appended. The digest is of the *raw* name, so the suffix
//     distinguishes exactly the thing sanitization made indistinguishable.
//
// Every member of a colliding group is suffixed, not just the losers. There is
// no principled winner — the server did not order them and the sort here is
// alphabetical, not meaningful — so picking one would hand a stable name to an
// arbitrary tool and move it the day a sibling was renamed. Suffixing the whole
// group makes the outcome symmetric, and no tool's name depends on which of its
// colliding siblings sorted first.
//
// A name is stable for as long as its collision group is. Adding a tool that
// collides with an existing one renames both; removing it renames the survivor
// back. That is inherent in resolving collisions at all, and it is safe here
// because a rename is a catalog change: it produces a new digest, a new
// generation, and an adoption at a safe boundary, rather than a silent
// substitution under a live turn.
