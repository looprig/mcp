// This file is the sampling seam: the conversion between the SDK's
// sampling/createMessage request and this package's neutral types, plus the
// Session-side handler that carries one to the client's callback.
//
// Sampling inverts trust the same way elicitation does — a server *asks* rather
// than answers — but what it asks for is different, and worse. Elicitation asks
// for a person's attention; sampling asks for the host's model, which means the
// host's money. A server that can drive sampling can spend on the host's
// account, so two things are load-bearing here:
//
//   - The capability must never be advertised on a client's behalf (see
//     Session.Initialize). A server only asks because it was told it may.
//   - What arrives is a *request*, never an instruction. The server's model
//     preferences, sampling parameters, and context requests are dropped at this
//     boundary rather than carried: the host picks the model and the budget, and
//     a field that reached a handler would be a field a handler might honor.
//
// What this boundary deliberately does not carry, and why:
//
//   - ModelPreferences, Temperature, StopSequences, Metadata — the server's
//     preferences for how the host's model should run. The design gives model
//     selection to the application, so a server's opinion about it is not
//     modelled. Dropping them is not a limitation to be fixed later: carrying
//     them would let a server steer spend it does not pay for.
//   - IncludeContext — a request that the host attach context from this (or
//     every) MCP server to the prompt. Honoring it would mean a server could
//     make the host harvest other servers' data into a prompt it will see the
//     completion of. It is dropped, and the matching capability
//     (SamplingCapabilities.Context) is never advertised, so a well-behaved
//     server does not ask.
//   - Tool use — the SDK models tool-bearing sampling as a separate handler
//     (CreateMessageWithToolsHandler) with its own advertised capability. This
//     module registers only the basic CreateMessageHandler and never advertises
//     SamplingCapabilities.Tools, so tools cannot enter a sampling request at
//     all. That is the structural half of the design's "sampling never receives
//     an unrestricted tool registry": there is no field to put one in.
//
// Non-text content (image, audio, tool_use, tool_result) is refused rather than
// dropped. A conversation with a message silently removed is a different
// conversation from the one the server sent, and this module will not ask a
// model to complete something nobody wrote.
