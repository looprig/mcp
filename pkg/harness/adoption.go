// This file moves a validated candidate catalog into a Loop's live toolset, and
// it does it at the only moment that is safe: the Loop's own idle.
//
// The shape follows design §Catalog model exactly, and the diagram there is the
// whole specification:
//
//	generation 5 [candidate, validated]
//	        |
//	Loop A reaches idle ----------------> generation 5 [adopted by A]
//	        |
//	Loop B remains active
//	        |
//	Loop B reaches idle ----------------> generation 5 [adopted by B]
//
// Two things in that picture are easy to conflate and must not be. A binding
// adopts a generation once — it is one connection with one current view of one
// server, and Client.Adopt is a pointer swap. A *Loop* adopts a toolset
// separately, at its own boundary, because a toolset is what a turn is running
// under and swapping it mid-turn would change the tools out from under a model
// that has already been shown them. So Loop A's idle moves the binding to
// generation 5 AND installs A's snapshot; Loop B goes on running the snapshot it
// already holds — genuinely the old generation's tools — until B parks, and B
// installs then. Nothing waits for anything.
//
// Every failure here leaves the Loop with the toolset it had. That is not this
// file's achievement: loop.ExternalToolInstaller is atomic and refuses whole
// replacements (an unbuildable definition, a name colliding with a declared
// tool), so the failure modes this file must get right are the ones about
// noticing, reporting, and trying again at the next boundary — never about
// half-installing.
