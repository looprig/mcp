// This file turns a server's request for human input into a Harness gate, and a
// human's answer back into an MCP elicitation response.
//
// # The shape of the problem
//
// Elicitation is the one place where an untrusted third-party server gets to put
// words in front of a person and ask them to type something. Everything here
// follows from that. The server chooses the message, the field names, and the
// schema; none of it is an instruction to this host, and all of it is input to
// be validated before a human ever sees it (CLAUDE.md: validate at every
// boundary; design §Elicitation: "Unsupported or unsafe schema constructs are
// declined with a classified error").
//
// # Why a decline is the failure mode, and never an error
//
// Every refusal in this file returns ElicitDecline, not a Go error. MCP models
// "the human said no" as a first-class result, and a host that cannot safely ask
// the question is in exactly that position: it has decided, on the human's
// behalf, not to answer. Returning an error instead would make the server's
// request fail — which reads to the server as "this client is broken" rather
// than "this client refused", and on the initialize path would take the
// connection down over a schema this adapter simply would not render.
//
// The server is told "decline" and nothing else. Why it was declined goes to the
// host's Reporter, never to the server: "your field named api_key was rejected
// as credential-soliciting" is a probe result, and a server that can enumerate
// this host's rules can search for a phrasing that gets past them.
//
// # What is deliberately NOT here
//
// There is no response route back from a Harness Session's gate directory, and
// this file does not pretend otherwise. Deps.Gates is a host-implemented seam:
// the host renders the gate — in a TUI, over HTTP, or from a headless policy —
// and returns the answer. That is design §Elicitation's own picture, where the
// three renderers sit downstream of the gate. See the report accompanying this
// stage for why a real sessionruntime.Session cannot currently be that host.

//
// It is NOT a security boundary against a HOSTILE server, and must never be
// relied on as one. Three reasons, all structural and none fixable by adding
// words to a list:
//
//   - It is a denylist over English tokens. Intent is not recoverable from a
//     third-party-authored schema; the rule can only recognize the shapes a
//     server chose to write down.
//   - "format": "password" and "writeOnly": true are the only RELIABLE signals
//     here, and they are reliable only because a server volunteered them. A
//     server that wants the value journaled simply does not declare them.
//   - Non-English, transliterated, or oblique naming walks past it. A field
//     named "mot_de_passe", or "value" under a message reading "the string from
//     your dashboard's top-right panel", tokenizes to nothing on either list.
//
// # The residual risk, stated plainly
//
// Form answers are journaled UNREDACTED — they are user-authored content, the
// same as command.UserInput. Redaction is not a second layer behind this check;
// there is no second layer. So: a determined server CAN still get a secret into
// the durable journal, by naming a field innocuously and asking for the secret
// in words this rule does not recognize. What this rule buys is that it has to
// be determined and deliberate, not careless. That is the whole claim. Anything
// stronger — a human confirmation before a free-text answer is journaled, or a
// per-binding policy refusing free-text fields from untrusted servers — is a
// control that does not exist yet and is an owner's decision, not this file's.
//
// A field solicits a credential when ANY of:
//
//  1. its JSON Schema says so: "format": "password", or "writeOnly": true. Both
//     are the schema author's own declaration that the value is a secret.
//  2. its NAME tokenizes to a credential word, or an adjacent credential pair.
//  3. its TITLE does the same. The title is what a person actually reads, so a
//     field named "f1" titled "API Key" is caught by this and not by (2).
//
// A field's Description is deliberately NOT matched. It is per-field prose, and
// prose about credentials is mostly prose telling a person NOT to enter one —
// "this is not your password" would reject itself. A rule that fires on that is
// one an integrator learns to work around by deleting their own safety text.
//
// # The body rule
//
// The form's MESSAGE is matched, under a narrower rule, because the field
// signals alone left an obvious hole: a server can name a field "value", give it
// no title, and put "paste your API key here" in the message. Every check above
// passes, and the answer is journaled. bodySolicitsCredential closes that
// particular shape.
//
// The body is prose, so the Description argument applies to it too — which is
// why the body rule is not "contains a credential token". Two conditions bound
// the false positives, and a false positive here is expensive: it declines a
// legitimate server's form for the words in its own message.
//
//  1. The body must pair a credential token with a SOLICITATION VERB — "enter",
//     "paste", "provide". "We never ask for your password" carries the token but
//     no verb, and is not a solicitation.
//  2. The form must have at least one FREE-TEXT field. A secret cannot be typed
//     into a confirm or a select, so a form whose every field is one of those has
//     nowhere for the body's request to land, whatever the body says.
//
// Those bounds are honest about what they leave: "we will never ask you to enter
// your password" alongside a free-text field still trips condition 1, because
// negation is not something a token list can see. That is a known, accepted
// false positive — it declines, an operator reads the Notice, and no secret is
// journaled. Fail closed.
//
// When the body solicits, the WHOLE form is rejected — the same rule as a bad
// field, for the same reason. There is no narrower unit available: the body is
// addressed to the form, not to a field, so there is no way to know WHICH
// free-text field it meant. Dropping every free-text field and rendering the
// rest would hand the server a partial answer it never asked for.
//
// Tokenization splits on non-alphanumerics AND camelCase boundaries, which is
// what makes the word list safe to keep short: "apiKey", "api_key", and
// "API-KEY" all tokenize to ["api","key"], while "author" tokenizes to
// ["author"] and so does not collide with the "auth" token. Matching raw
// substrings instead would reject "author", "authority", and "tokenizer".
//
// It is deliberately over-inclusive within that. A field genuinely named "token"
// in an MCP form is a credential essentially every time, and the cost of the
// rare false positive is a declined form and a Notice an operator can read —
// against the cost of a false negative, which is a bearer token in a durable
// journal record forever.
