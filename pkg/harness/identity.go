// This file answers one question for a composing application: is the MCP
// configuration this Session is about to resume under the same configuration it
// ran under before?
//
// It answers it with identity, not with configuration. A BindingIdentity is a
// secret-free description of a binding — what it is mounted as, who may see it,
// where it points, what it will bend for, and what the server turned out to
// offer — reduced to values and digests that are safe to persist in a journal,
// render in a UI, and ship to telemetry. The design's manifest list (§Session
// restore and configuration identity) is its field list, and the exclusions are
// the same design's: credentials, tokens, raw headers, full environment values,
// resource contents, prompt bodies, and tool results are not here.
//
// The exclusions hold structurally rather than by care. Nothing in this file
// can reach a secret: a Definition is secret-free by construction (credentials
// arrive via providers at connect time, held in closures), a transport surfaces
// only Kind and RedactedOrigin, and a catalog carries schema digests rather
// than schema bytes. A test puts a canary in every secret-bearing input the
// module has and proves it reaches neither an identity value nor the digest.
//
// # What this is not
//
// It is not a configuration manifest, an epoch, or a typed drift report. Those
// belong to 2026-07-16-session-versioning-migration-design.md, which is
// deferred. Harness today has one-shot event.ConfigFingerprint stamped at
// SessionStarted and a boolean restore override, so what this module
// contributes is a digest that fits that model: one string, compared for
// equality, empty when there is no MCP configuration at all. See ConfigDigest.
