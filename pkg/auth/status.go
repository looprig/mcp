// This file defines what a caller may observe about a binding's auth posture.
//
// Status is the counterpart to TokenSet: same subject, opposite contract.
// TokenSet holds the credential and refuses to be printed; Status holds no
// credential and is built to be printed — logged, rendered in a UI, and shipped
// to telemetry as-is. Keeping them as two types is what lets the second be
// freely copied into observability paths that the first must never enter.
//
// Nothing here may ever carry token material. The fields are exactly the
// non-secret facts: what state auth is in, when it lapses, what it is good for,
// and a bounded classification of why it failed.
