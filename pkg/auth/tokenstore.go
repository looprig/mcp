// This file defines the token-persistence contract: what identifies a token
// (Key), what a token is (TokenSet), where tokens live (TokenStore), and a
// reference store for tests and deliberately-ephemeral applications
// (MemoryStore).
//
// TokenSet's fields are unexported. That is the whole secret-safety design, and
// it is worth stating why it beats the obvious alternative of exported fields
// plus redacting String/GoString/MarshalJSON methods:
//
//   - Redacting methods only cover the paths that call them. Unexported fields
//     also close the paths that do not: encoding/json and encoding/gob have
//     nothing to reflect over.
//   - `set.Access` as a field is a leak one keystroke away, and reviewing for
//     it means reviewing every use forever. `set.Access()` as a method is the
//     same keystroke, but it is greppable: the audit question "who reads token
//     material?" has an exact, finite answer.
//   - Unexported slices make the aliasing bug class structurally impossible.
//     A caller cannot hold a reference into a stored TokenSet's scopes, because
//     the only way out is Scopes(), which clones.
//
// Unexported fields are necessary but NOT sufficient, and it is worth being
// exact about why, because the obvious mental model is wrong: fmt's reflection
// path reads unexported fields perfectly well. `fmt.Sprintf("%d", set)` on a
// type with only a Stringer prints the tokens verbatim, because fmt consults
// Stringer for just %v, %s, %q, %x and %X and sends every other verb to
// reflection. That is why these types implement fmt.Formatter, which fmt
// consults first, for every verb. String and GoString remain for direct callers
// and for readable output; Format is what makes the coverage total.
//
// Formatter still leaves three paths uncovered — %p and %w, which fmt resolves
// before consulting it; anything routed through badVerb, which suppresses
// methods; and a value inside someone else's unexported field, which fmt
// reaches by reflection but cannot call a method on. Those are closed by where
// the bytes live rather than by any method: see the secret type below.
//
// MarshalJSON refuses rather than redacts. Redacting would make
// json.Marshal(set) succeed and silently produce a token-shaped document with
// no token in it: a store built that way passes its round-trip test only if the
// test checks the token, and fails in production by losing credentials. Since
// Access/Refresh exist as the deliberate way to persist, there is no legitimate
// caller of json.Marshal on a TokenSet, and the honest answer to an illegitimate
// one is a loud error.

//   - a TokenSet or Header held in another struct's unexported field, which
//     fmt reaches by reflection but cannot call a method on (CanInterface is
//     false).
//
// A plain string field prints the credential in full down all three. A pointer
