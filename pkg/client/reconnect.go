// This file implements bounded reconnection: a binding whose connection died
// for a transient reason builds a new one, without disturbing what it has
// already promised its callers.
//
// # What a reconnect is allowed to assume
//
// Nothing. The design's gate is four conjunctive conditions — the owner is live,
// the failure is classified transient, policy permits it, and the retry budget
// (count, delay, total) is not spent — and every one of them is a way of saying
// that reconnecting is not the default response to a connection that stopped
// working. A binding that reconnects through an auth denial is a lockout; one
// that reconnects forever is a storm; one that reconnects after its owner is
// gone is a leak.
//
// # What a reconnect must not do: replay
//
// A tool call that was in flight when the connection died has an indeterminate
// outcome. The request may never have arrived, may have arrived and run, or may
// have run and had its reply lost — and nothing at this layer can tell those
// apart, because the only evidence is on the other side of a connection that no
// longer exists. So the call is reported as FailureIndeterminate and never
// retried. This is the design's rule and it is the reason a reconnect is not
// transparent: re-sending "delete the branch" because the first reply went
// missing is how a resilience feature deletes a branch twice.
//
// Reads are different in kind but treated the same way here: they are not
// replayed either, because the caller is the layer that knows whether re-reading
// is what it wants. What differs is the class it is told — a lost read is a
// closed transport, not an indeterminate effect.
//
// # What survives a reconnect
//
// The adopted generation. A new connection discovers a complete candidate, and
// that candidate waits for the caller's safe boundary exactly like one from a
// list-change notification. Swapping a Loop's toolset because a socket blinked
// would be the same mid-turn mutation the candidate/adopted split exists to
// prevent — the connection changed, but nothing the model was told has.
