// This file defines compatibility profiles: the named, versioned policy for how
// far a binding will bend for a server that does not implement the
// specification perfectly.
//
// # Why a closed enum, not a set of booleans
//
// The design divides deviations into safe and unsafe, and the unsafe list is not
// a warning — it is a list of things that must be impossible:
//
//   - replacing an invalid input schema with unconstrained arguments;
//   - disabling TLS verification;
//   - treating malformed framing as a valid message;
//   - retrying non-idempotent tool calls;
//   - treating an auth failure as anonymous success.
//
// None of them can be requested here, because none of them can be *named* here.
// Tolerance is a closed enum of exactly the three safe deviations, so a
// configuration — however misguided, and whatever an operator pastes into it —
// has no way to express "widen the arguments". A profile is a choice among safe
// options, not a dial that goes to unsafe. compat_test.go asserts the enum's
// declared range is exactly those three, so adding an unsafe member is a test
// failure rather than a review question.
//
// # Why profiles are versioned
//
// A profile is part of the binding's configuration identity (see Digest). What
// "default" tolerates may change as this module learns about more servers, and a
// manifest recording that a session ran under "default" would then record
// nothing at all. The version is what makes the record mean something a year
// later.
