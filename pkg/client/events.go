// This file defines the catalog members of the Event union and the client's
// event emitter.
//
// Every event is safe metadata by construction, which is a property of what the
// types can hold rather than of what the emitters remember to put in them: there
// is no field on any event here that can carry a credential, a tool argument, a
// resource body, or an unbounded string. The one free-text field an event has
// (Message, on the failure-shaped events) is filled from an *Error's already
// bounded Msg. See events_test.go, which sweeps the union by reflection and
// fails on a field that could hold anything else.
//
// The sealed Event interface and StateChanged live in handlers.go, next to the
// EventHandler that receives them.

// # Auth state: deferred, and why
//
// The design's event set also lists auth state. It is not here.
//
// (Elicitation was listed alongside it and is no longer deferred:
// internal/protocol's session now registers an SDK elicitation handler — guarded
// so the capability is never advertised on a client's behalf — and the client
// wires Handlers.Elicitation to it, so the two events above have a real
// producer. See Client.elicitAdapter.)
//
// Auth state has a producer and no seam. This is worth stating precisely,
// because the obvious reading — "nothing authenticates yet" — is false and would
// send whoever picks this up looking in the wrong place:
//
//   - pkg/auth models the posture fully and tracks it live: auth.Status,
//     auth.State (anonymous/required/authenticated/expired/denied/failed), and
//     OAuthProvider.Status(), which reports what the last completed flow
//     established without blocking or performing I/O.
//   - pkg/transport/streamablehttp authenticates for real: Config.Auth is an
//     auth.HeaderProvider consulted per request, and its diagnostics record the
//     first auth failure (see recordAuthError/authError), which already reaches
//     callers as a classified FailureAuth* error.
//
// What is missing is the wire between them, and it is more than a field:
//
//   - protocol.ConnectConfig has OnLog and OnListChanged but no OnAuth. Adding
//     one means either importing pkg/auth into internal/protocol — inverting the
//     module's layering, since protocol is the SDK boundary and today depends on
//     nothing above it — or mirroring auth.State into a neutral enum here, the
//     way client.State mirrors lifecycle.State.
//   - a transport holds an auth.HeaderProvider, whose only method is Headers.
//     It cannot observe a posture through that interface: reaching Status()
//     needs an optional-interface assertion, which is a new cross-package
//     contract rather than a wiring detail.
//   - auth.Status is a snapshot, not a stream, so *when* to read it is a policy
//     decision — realistically after each Headers call, in a transport's
//     per-request path, with change detection so that a steady state does not
//     emit an event per request.
//   - lifecycle.StateAuthenticating is declared and never entered in production
//     as a direct consequence: Connect goes starting -> discovering, because
//     nothing tells it that this binding's transport authenticates at all. That
//     needs its own seam (the client must know before it dials, not after).
//
// So the work is a protocol contract, a transport contract, an observation
// policy, and a lifecycle seam — across three packages, two of them outside this
// phase. It is deferred deliberately rather than approximated: an
// AuthStateChanged that only ever fired on failure would be a worse contract
// than none, and inferring "authenticated" from "the server did not refuse us"
// would put this module's guess where pkg/auth deliberately reports a fact (see
// StatusOf: the states that are not derivable are built by the flow that learns
// them).
