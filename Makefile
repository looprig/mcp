# This module does not vendor. go.mod pins exact versions and go.sum verifies

# adds only offline builds and source-level dependency diffs. It also actively
# misleads: a stale vendor/ is ignored under a go.work but silently satisfies a
# GOWORK=off build, so standalone verification tests the vendored copy rather
# than the version go.mod actually pins — which is precisely what standalone
# verification exists to check.
